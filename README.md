### Recommended Learning Path

Start with Chapter 1 and work sequentially through the chapters. Each chapter builds on previous concepts.

## Exercises

Each chapter includes progressive exercises:

- **Exercise 01-XX**: Introduction exercises
- **Exercise 02-XX**: Paradigms exploration
- **Exercise 03-XX**: Class creation practice
- **Exercise 04-XX**: Properties and validation
- **Exercise 05-XX**: Encapsulation mastery

##  Mini Projects

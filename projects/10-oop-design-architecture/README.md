# Mini Project: Library Management System Refactor

## Project Overview

Transform a messy, poorly-designed library system into YOUR well-architected masterpiece! This is YOUR project to own‚Äîtake a tightly-coupled, violation-riddled codebase and refactor it using all the SOLID principles you've learned. You'll create a flexible, maintainable system that demonstrates professional software design.

You'll combine everything from Chapter 10: Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Dependency Inversion, composition over inheritance, and clean architectural patterns to build a library system that's easy to test, extend, and maintain.

## Why This Project?

Refactoring messy code is a critical skill every developer needs. In the real world, you'll rarely start with a clean slate‚Äîyou'll inherit codebases that need improvement. This project teaches you to:
- Identify design violations systematically
- Apply SOLID principles to improve existing code
- Separate concerns into focused components
- Build systems that are easy to extend
- Create testable, maintainable architectures

These are the same patterns used in professional software development to keep large codebases manageable and flexible.

## Learning Goals

- Apply all SOLID principles in one cohesive system
- Identify and fix violations of each principle
- Design clean, layered architecture
- Use dependency injection effectively
- Build extensible systems using interfaces
- Create focused, single-purpose classes
- Write code that's easy to test and maintain

## The Messy Code

YOU'VE been given this poorly-designed library system to refactor:

```csharp
// ‚ùå VIOLATES ALL SOLID PRINCIPLES!
class Library
{
    private List<string> books = new List<string>();
    private Dictionary<string, string> borrowedBooks = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    
    // Violates SRP - does EVERYTHING
    public void AddBook(string title)
    {
        // Validation
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(title))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: Title cannot be empty");
            return;
        }
        
        // Business logic
        books.Add(title);
        
        // File I/O
        File.AppendAllText("books.txt", title + "\n");
        
        // UI
        Console.WriteLine($"‚úì Added: {title}");
    }
    
    // Violates OCP - must modify to add new book types
    public void DisplayBooks()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("=== Library Books ===");
        foreach (var book in books)
        {
            if (book.StartsWith("Fiction:"))
                Console.WriteLine($"üìñ {book}");
            else if (book.StartsWith("NonFiction:"))
                Console.WriteLine($"üìö {book}");
            // Must modify this method for every new type!
        }
    }
    
    // Violates DIP - tightly coupled to specific implementations
    public void BorrowBook(string title, string borrower)
    {
        if (!books.Contains(title))
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Book not available");
            return;
        }
        
        borrowedBooks[title] = borrower;
        books.Remove(title);
        
        // Hard-coded file storage
        File.AppendAllText("borrowed.txt", $"{borrower}:{title}\n");
        
        Console.WriteLine($"{borrower} borrowed {title}");
    }
}
```

YOUR mission: Fix all these violations!

## Minimum Requirements

YOUR refactored library system MUST include:

### 1. Apply Single Responsibility Principle

Create separate classes for different responsibilities:
- `Book` class - Represents book data only
- `BookValidator` - Validates book data
- `LibraryService` - Core business logic
- `IBookRepository` interface - Storage abstraction
- `FileBookRepository` - File-based storage implementation
- `LibraryUI` - Console interface/display

**Each class has ONE reason to change!**

### 2. Apply Open/Closed Principle

Design for extension without modification:
- Create `Book` base class or `IBook` interface
- Implement different book types (`FictionBook`, `NonFictionBook`, `ReferenceBook`)
- Add new book types WITHOUT modifying existing code
- Use polymorphism for book-specific behavior

### 3. Apply Dependency Inversion Principle

Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes:
- Create `IBookRepository` interface for storage
- Create `ILogger` interface for logging
- Inject dependencies through constructors
- Demonstrate swapping implementations easily

### 4. Demonstrate Composition Over Inheritance

Where appropriate:
- Use composition to add capabilities
- Avoid deep inheritance hierarchies
- Show flexibility of composed designs

### 5. Build Clean Architecture

Organize YOUR system into layers:
- **Data Layer**: `Book`, `BookData` classes
- **Repository Layer**: `IBookRepository`, implementations
- **Service Layer**: `LibraryService` (business logic)
- **Presentation Layer**: `LibraryUI` (console interface)

### 6. Make It Testable

Design to enable testing:
- Create mock implementations of interfaces
- Demonstrate testing with mocks
- Show how SOLID makes testing easy

## Hints

**Book class (SRP - data only):**
```csharp
class Book
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Author { get; set; }
    public string ISBN { get; set; }
    public BookType Type { get; set; }
    
    public Book(string title, string author, string isbn, BookType type)
    {
        Title = title;
        Author = author;
        ISBN = isbn;
        Type = type;
    }
}

enum BookType
{
    Fiction,
    NonFiction,
    Reference,
    Technical
}
```

**Repository interface (DIP):**
```csharp
interface IBookRepository
{
    void Add(Book book);
    void Remove(Book book);
    Book FindByTitle(string title);
    List<Book> GetAllAvailable();
    void SaveBorrowed(string bookTitle, string borrower);
}
```

**File repository implementation:**
```csharp
class FileBookRepository : IBookRepository
{
    private List<Book> books = new List<Book>();
    
    public void Add(Book book)
    {
        books.Add(book);
        // Save to file
        File.AppendAllText("books.txt", 
            $"{book.Title}|{book.Author}|{book.ISBN}|{book.Type}\n");
    }
    
    public Book FindByTitle(string title)
    {
        return books.Find(b => b.Title == title);
    }
    
    // ... other methods
}
```

**Memory repository (for testing):**
```csharp
class MemoryBookRepository : IBookRepository
{
    private List<Book> books = new List<Book>();
    private Dictionary<string, string> borrowed = new Dictionary<string, string>();
    
    public void Add(Book book)
    {
        books.Add(book);
        // No file I/O - just memory
    }
    
    // ... other methods (no file operations)
}
```

**Service layer with DI:**
```csharp
class LibraryService
{
    private IBookRepository repository;
    private ILogger logger;
    
    // Dependency Injection via constructor
    public LibraryService(IBookRepository repo, ILogger log)
    {
        repository = repo;
        logger = log;
    }
    
    public void AddBook(Book book)
    {
        // Validation
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(book.Title))
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Title cannot be empty");
        }
        
        // Business logic
        repository.Add(book);
        logger.Log($"Added book: {book.Title}");
    }
    
    public void BorrowBook(string title, string borrower)
    {
        Book book = repository.FindByTitle(title);
        if (book == null)
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Book not found");
        }
        
        repository.SaveBorrowed(title, borrower);
        repository.Remove(book);
        logger.Log($"{borrower} borrowed {title}");
    }
}
```

**UI layer:**
```csharp
class LibraryUI
{
    private LibraryService service;
    
    public LibraryUI(LibraryService svc)
    {
        service = svc;
    }
    
    public void DisplayBooks(List<Book> books)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n=== Available Books ===");
        foreach (var book in books)
        {
            string icon = book.Type == BookType.Fiction ? "üìñ" : "üìö";
            Console.WriteLine($"{icon} {book.Title} by {book.Author}");
        }
    }
    
    public void DisplayBorrowSuccess(string title, string borrower)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"‚úì {borrower} borrowed \"{title}\"");
    }
}
```

**Main program demonstrating flexibility:**
```csharp
// Production configuration
var fileRepo = new FileBookRepository();
var fileLogger = new FileLogger();
var service = new LibraryService(fileRepo, fileLogger);
var ui = new LibraryUI(service);

// Add books
service.AddBook(new Book("1984", "Orwell", "123", BookType.Fiction));
ui.DisplayBooks(service.GetAvailableBooks());

// Easy to switch to testing configuration!
var memoryRepo = new MemoryBookRepository();
var consoleLogger = new ConsoleLogger();
var testService = new LibraryService(memoryRepo, consoleLogger);
// No changes to service code needed!
```

## Reflection Questions

After building YOUR library system, consider:

1. Which SOLID violation was hardest to fix? Why?
2. How does SRP make YOUR code easier to test?
3. What would YOU need to change to add a DatabaseRepository?
4. How does DIP make YOUR system more flexible?
5. Where did composition work better than inheritance?
6. How would YOUR architecture handle 100,000 books?
7. What design patterns emerged naturally?
8. How easy is it to add a new feature now?

## Connection to Real-World Systems

YOUR library system uses the same patterns as:
- **E-commerce platforms** - Products, orders, inventory
- **Banking systems** - Accounts, transactions, storage
- **Healthcare systems** - Patients, records, compliance
- **Social media** - Posts, users, notifications
- **Enterprise applications** - Clean architecture everywhere

The SOLID principles YOU applied here scale to systems with millions of users!
